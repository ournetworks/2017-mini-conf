Thank you all for making State of Our Networks a success this past Saturday!

We had over 40 attendees who got hands-on with Arduinos and low power sensor networks as well as Raspberry Pis for mesh networks nodes in the morning workshops, had a lively conversations about the history of Toronto's networks and discussed upcoming plans with Toronto Community Networks, EtherMesh, and Toronto Mesh members. [Pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/glennmcknight/albums/72157675518024343) and [audio](https://soundcloud.com/gmcknight/mesh-toronto-panel-discussion) are online, with video of the afternoon presentations shortly to come on https://tomesh.net/.
