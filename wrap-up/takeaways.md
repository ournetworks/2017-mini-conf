# Day of Takeaways

For workshops:
- Survey before about skill level/background
- Decide on a ratio of helpers to attendees (1 to 5?)
- Have instructions on a **pad** like a cryptpad that people can visit (e.g. SWC-style)
- EXPLAIN TERMINOLOGY
  - Think about terms that might be unfamiliar (based on background)
  - Ensure this

- Did we do a bait and switch? (Was workshops in the morning a good model?)

Technical issues:
- Mesh workshop: Interference an issue? Too many nodes set up on routers close to each other
- Only 2 cable runs to the same table. Need a way to use some switches to spread it out
- Helpful to do some grouping similar operating systems for peer troubleshooting
- What is the ideal size to work on a small device? (4-6 at tables) but that might be lower (2-4)
