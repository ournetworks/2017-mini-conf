Hi,

I'm with Toronto Mesh, a group looking to build community-owned internet and networking infrastructure here in the city since April of this year.

We are organizing a one-day 'State of Our Networks' event on January 14, 2017 in order to: engage with people interested in the same things we are, build (social) networks with similar projects and people involved in this space in Toronto, and begin to check in on aspects of our emerging deployment strategy.

<!-- Panel Session -->
In the afternoon we are organizing a panel session on the history of Canadian computing and Toronto's Networks. We are seeking speakers who are interested in presenting for 15 minutes on a related topic and engaging in a 20-30 conversation afterwards.

<!-- Interactive Session -->
In the afternoon we are organizing an interactive/discussion session around visions for what the internet and networks in Toronto could be. We imagine the format as 3-5 groups or 'pitches' who would lead a conversation/activities to generate discussion with 5-10 participants about that vision.
